# First posts
Published on: 2023-10-07

Taking a break from coding in Rust by trying out the new view transitions added in the
latest Astro release.

## Subsection

Things I'm currently working on:

1. **Godot**: playing around with Godot and Blender by making some 3D models, importing them into Godot and making a simple RPG style playground.
2. **Rust**: lots of sideprojects and working through some books. Most recently the _Zero To Production_ book which I'm close to finishing. Also working
on a CLI to be able to generate invoices, using only Clap and Minijinja to generate latex files from templates and producing PDF files.
3. **Next.js/Typescript**: Various websites, including one which allows people to place orders for a food menu, mainly targeting offices who want to collectively place orders for lunch.
4. **Other**: A general-purpose Organisation package in Julia to manage external API integrations such as Quire, Google Drive, Gitlab, etc.
